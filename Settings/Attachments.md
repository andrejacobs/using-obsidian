#settings/attachments

I like to keep related attachments (like images) for a note to be organised in a subfolder named `attachments` in the same folder as the note.

For example I have a note named "Setting up and syncing ..." and any images I drag and drop into the note automatically get stored inside the directory named `attachments`
