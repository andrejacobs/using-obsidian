* #tip The exported Excalidraw diagrams will be placed using the same [[Attachment settings]] when you embed a new diagram in a note. However if you use the "Create new drawing" button on the sidebar it will be placed in the main Excalidraw folder.
* Save Excalidraw files in their own root folder.

* Default is to export the background colour. You can turn this off to have transparent .svg and or .png.
