![[Vault stored in iCloud and GitHub.excalidraw.dark.svg]]

A while back I used the Obsidian iOS app and it created the directory named "Obsidian" inside of my iCloud Drive. Each directory inside of this Obsidian directory is assumed to be a vault and thus if you use the iOS app to open any of the subdirectories then a `.obsidian` directory will be created.

Currently I create new vaults using my preferred [[Setting up and syncing a new GitHub repository as an Obsidian vault]] guide and either clone the repo directly inside of the `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents` directory or first clone it somewhere else and then move the directory using Finder.
